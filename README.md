# Comparing the ethnicity distribution of Essex Policesearch with Workforce and Census data
The aim is to analyse the Stop and Search data by Essex police, find the ethnicity distribution among the people and compare it with the total population census and Police workforce. This could help in finding if there is any bias in the way that the police suspects a person at sight based on race  before they stop and search. To know if there are dominating races employed, the Essex police workforce data is taken into account for comparison. All these data from each set is correlated to find any evidence that shows the Police being prejudice in their inspections.
